This diploma project presents the design and implementation of a subscription-based Learning Management System (LMS) that offers a platform where educators can publish educational content based on subscription tiers while allowing students to purchase access to individual courses. The system addresses the need for a sustainable educational platform where content creators are compensated for their expertise, and learners have access to quality education at affordable prices.

The developed LMS incorporates key features such as tiered subscription plans for teachers based on student capacity limits, course pricing models, secure payment verification, content management tools, and interactive learning modules. The system uses modern web technologies including Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap for responsive design.

The research methodology involved requirements analysis, system design using object-oriented principles, agile implementation, and usability testing. The evaluation demonstrates that the system effectively manages educational content delivery while handling financial transactions securely.

The platform offers benefits to multiple stakeholders: teachers gain a monetization channel for their educational content, students access quality courses at varying price points, and educational institutions can leverage the platform to extend their reach beyond physical classrooms.
