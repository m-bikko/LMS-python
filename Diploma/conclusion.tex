\section{Conclusion}

This diploma project presented the design, implementation, and evaluation of a subscription-based Learning Management System (LMS) that introduces an innovative business model for educational content delivery. The project addressed the need for a platform that balances fair compensation for educators with flexible, affordable access for learners.

\subsection{Summary of Contributions}

The project has made several key contributions to the field of educational technology:

\subsubsection{Innovative Business Model}

The primary contribution is the development and implementation of a capacity-based subscription model for educators combined with course-specific payments for students. This dual approach offers several advantages over traditional LMS business models:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Teachers pay subscription fees based on their expected student capacity, aligning platform costs with potential revenue
    \item Students pay only for courses they wish to access, rather than platform-wide subscriptions
    \item The platform remains financially sustainable while allowing content creators to retain most of their course revenue
    \item The payment verification system provides financial integrity without the regulatory complexity of direct payment processing
\end{itemize}

This business model represents a novel approach in the educational technology landscape, bridging the gap between institutional LMS platforms and content marketplaces.

\subsubsection{Technical Implementation}

The project delivered a fully functional LMS platform with several notable technical features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comprehensive user role system with differentiated capabilities for administrators, teachers, and students
    \item Flexible content management system for organizing educational materials
    \item Robust payment verification system for both teacher subscriptions and student enrollments
    \item Responsive user interface that works across desktop and mobile devices
    \item Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms
\end{itemize}

The implementation demonstrates that a relatively lightweight technology stack (Flask, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap) can deliver a feature-rich educational platform without excessive complexity.

\subsubsection{Educational Technology Insights}

Through the development and evaluation process, the project has generated valuable insights into educational technology design:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The importance of aligning business models with stakeholder interests
    \item The need for flexible payment models that accommodate diverse educational contexts
    \item The value of clear verification processes in maintaining platform integrity
    \item The balance between feature richness and usability in educational interfaces
\end{itemize}

These insights contribute to the broader understanding of effective educational technology design and implementation.

\subsection{Reflection on Project Objectives}

Reflecting on the original project objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Develop a platform that enables teachers to publish courses based on subscription tiers linked to student capacity limits}: This objective was successfully achieved. The implemented system allows teachers to select from four subscription tiers with different student capacity limits.
    
    \item \textbf{Implement a system where students can purchase access to individual courses at prices set by the educators}: This objective was successfully achieved. Teachers can set individual prices for their courses, and students can purchase access to specific courses that interest them.
    
    \item \textbf{Create secure verification mechanisms for payment receipts to maintain financial integrity}: This objective was successfully achieved. The system includes separate verification processes for teacher subscriptions and student enrollments, with appropriate approval workflows.
    
    \item \textbf{Design an intuitive, responsive user interface that enhances the learning experience}: This objective was partially achieved. While the interface is functional and responsive, there is room for improvement in mobile optimization and workflow efficiency.
    
    \item \textbf{Establish a sustainable business model that fairly compensates all stakeholders}: This objective was successfully achieved. The implemented model balances platform sustainability with fair compensation for educators.
\end{enumerate}

Overall, the project successfully met most of its objectives, with partial success in user interface design that could be addressed in future iterations.

\subsection{Challenges and Limitations}

The project faced several challenges and has certain limitations that are important to acknowledge:

\subsubsection{Technical Challenges}

Key technical challenges included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementing secure file upload handling for payment receipts and certificates
    \item Developing an accurate tracking system for student capacity within subscription tiers
    \item Ensuring proper functioning of modal dialogs for certificate and receipt viewing
    \item Balancing responsive design with feature completeness across different devices
\end{itemize}

While solutions were found for these challenges, they highlight the complexity of developing robust educational platforms.

\subsubsection{Limitations}

The project has several limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Limited Automation}: The payment verification process relies on manual verification, which may not scale efficiently with large user numbers.
    
    \item \textbf{Restricted Analytics}: The current implementation lacks advanced learning analytics that could enhance the educational experience.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited Collaboration Tools}: Real-time collaboration features are absent from the current implementation.
    
    \item \textbf{Simplified Assessment}: The assessment tools focus on basic quiz functionality rather than sophisticated evaluation methods.
\end{itemize}

These limitations represent opportunities for future development rather than fundamental flaws in the current implementation.

\subsection{Future Work}

Based on the evaluation and identified limitations, several directions for future work emerge:

\subsubsection{Technical Enhancements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Semi-Automated Verification}: Implementing computer vision or machine learning techniques to assist with payment receipt verification

\subsection{Broader Implications}

The subscription-based LMS model developed in this project has broader implications for educational technology:

\subsubsection{Democratization of Educational Content Creation}

By providing a fair compensation model for educators outside institutional contexts, the platform contributes to the democratization of educational content creation. This approach could enable more diverse voices to participate in online education, potentially enriching the educational landscape with specialized knowledge that might not find a place in traditional institutional offerings.

\subsubsection{Alternative to Revenue Sharing Models}

The capacity-based subscription approach offers an alternative to dominant revenue sharing models that typically take 30-50\% of educator earnings. This could influence the broader educational technology market to consider more creator-friendly business models.

\subsubsection{Localized Educational Ecosystems}

The payment verification approach, while partly implemented for practical reasons, has the potential to better support local educational ecosystems where international payment processing might be challenging. This could be particularly valuable in emerging markets where educational technology adoption is growing rapidly.
