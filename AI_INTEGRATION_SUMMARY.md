1. Login to the LMS at `http://127.0.0.1:5002`
2. Navigate to "Course Advisor" in the menu
3. Start chatting with the AI about course preferences
4. Receive personalized course recommendations

### Sample Conversations:
- "I want to learn programming but I'm a beginner"
- "What courses would help me become a data scientist?"
- "I have limited time, what's the shortest course available?"
- "Which courses are free?"

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

```
User Request → Flask Route → AI Service → Gemini API
     ↓              ↓           ↓           ↓
  Template ← Database ← Response ← AI Response
```

### Data Flow:
1. Student sends message via web interface
2. Message saved to database
3. Course data retrieved from database
4. Prompt constructed with courses + history
5. Gemini API generates response
6. Response saved and displayed to user

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- API key stored as environment variable
- User authentication required
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on AI requests
- Error handling for API failures

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- Efficient database queries for course data
- Conversation history limited to recent messages
- Async JavaScript for responsive UI
- Error recovery mechanisms

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- Modern chat interface design
- Distinct user vs AI message styling
- Typing indicators
- Message timestamps
- Clear history functionality
- Responsive mobile design

## 🔄 Future Enhancements (Optional)

Could be extended with:
- Multi-language support
- Voice input/output
