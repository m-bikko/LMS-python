## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Discussion Groups (one per course)
CREATE TABLE discussion_groups (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    course_id INTEGER UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(id)
);

-- Messages within groups
CREATE TABLE discussion_messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    group_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    sender_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    message_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'text',
    file_path VARCHAR(255),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    edited_at DATETIME,
    is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    FOREIGN KEY (group_id) REFERENCES discussion_groups(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Read receipts tracking
CREATE TABLE discussion_message_reads (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    message_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    read_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (message_id) REFERENCES discussion_messages(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    UNIQUE(message_id, user_id)
);
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /discussions/` - List all accessible discussion groups
- `GET /discussions/<group_id>` - View specific discussion group
- `POST /discussions/<group_id>/send` - Send message to group
- `GET /discussions/<group_id>/messages` - Get messages (for polling)
- `GET /discussions/<group_id>/participants` - Get group participants
- `GET /discussions/unread-count` - Get unread messages count

### Automatic Group Creation

Discussion groups are automatically created in these scenarios:

1. **When courses are approved** by admin
2. **When students enroll** in courses (if group doesn't exist)
3. **When running the setup script** for existing courses

### Security & Access Control

- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require login
- **Role-Based Access**: Only teachers, enrolled students, and admins can access
- **Payment Verification**: Students must have verified payments to participate
- **Group Isolation**: Users can only access groups for their enrolled/taught courses

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Discussion (Student)

```
Student: "Hi everyone! I'm having trouble understanding the concept of 
inheritance in OOP. Can someone help explain it?"

Teacher: "Great question! Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties 
and methods from another class. Think of it like a family tree..."

Another Student: "I found this helpful analogy: it's like how a child 
inherits traits from their parents but can also have their own unique features."
```

### Getting Help (Student)

```
Student: "I'm stuck on assignment 3, question 2. The code keeps giving me 
an error about undefined variables."

Teacher: "Can you share the specific error message? Also, make sure you've 
declared all variables before using them."

Student: "The error is: 'NameError: name 'x' is not defined'"

Teacher: "Ah, you need to initialize 'x' before the loop. Try adding 'x = 0' 
at the beginning of your function."
```
